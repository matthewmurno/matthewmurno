ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm Matthew Murno, a Computer Science graduate from Boston College, passionate about software engineering and continually expanding my skill set.

Initially, I focused on Front End Web Development, building projects like WatchedItâ€”a single-page React app for sharing favorite TV shows and movies with friends. This project reflects my love for creating clean, efficient, user-friendly applications.

As my interests evolved, I started to shift more into software engineering, particularly in game development. My current project is a portfolio website where I can show of some of the projects I've worked on.

ðŸ”­ Current Projects:
WatchedIt â€“ A React-based movie and TV show-sharing platform.
Atari Breakout Clone â€“ Exploring game mechanics with procedural elements for enhanced player experience.
Eagle Plan - A Django web application used to create 4-year plans for Boston College students
Wandering Mind -  a 2D isometric video game with combat, my first venture into a more modern style video game

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Learning:
I am delving into Node.js to expand my backend development skills, alongside software engineering principles.

ðŸŽ¨ Graphic Design:
Beyond coding, I enjoy graphic design, creating logos, icons, and other digital assets for my projects.
