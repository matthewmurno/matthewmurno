Hello and welcome to my github profile.

My name is Matthew Murno, I am currently a student at Boston College pursuing a Bachelors of Art in Computer Science, with a focus in Front End Web Development.

I enjoy building react applications and coming up with new ideas to tackle real world problems, as well as share information with friends.

Some of the projects that I have worked on include **WatchedIt**, a single page react application that allows you to share the shows and movies that you are interested with your friends. I'm very interested in sharing things with others, and always need something to watch, so I came up with the idea to create a web/mobile based application that you can use to share your interestes with others
