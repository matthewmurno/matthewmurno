ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Matthew Murno, a dedicated Computer Science student at Boston College with a passion for software engineering. While my focus initially leaned towards Front End Web Development, my journey has evolved, delving deeper into the realm of software engineering.

I find immense joy in crafting React applications and brainstorming innovative solutions to real-world challenges. One of my recent projects, WatchedIt, exemplifies this passion. It's a single-page React application designed for sharing favorite shows and movies with friends. As my interests expanded beyond web development, I'm now exploring the realm of game development.

My current endeavor involves creating a clone of Atari Breakout, with plans to implement procedural paddle leveling and other exciting features to enhance gameplay. Beyond coding, I've also honed my skills in graphic design, creating logos, icons, and other assets for various applications.

Continuously pushing my boundaries, I'm currently diving into WebGL to deepen my understanding of 3D graphics and game development. Exploring concepts like ray tracing and rasterization, I'm eager to unlock new possibilities in game design.
